## Project Overview

The Ossuary is a fully on-chain, web3 game that fuses art, mythology, and blockchain technology into an evolving, decentralized legend. Players perform smart contract-powered rituals using $OSIEN tokens (ERC-20), harnessing Chainlink VRF for provable randomness, to summon unique Relic NFTs, unlock hidden Lore Fragments, and support real artists.

**Core features:**

- **Web3 Game Mechanics:** Every player action is an on-chain ritual that creates, mutates, or destroys NFTs.
- **Mutable, Programmable NFTs:** Artifacts that change and grow based on player interactions.
- **Community-Driven Lore:** The story and world evolve through player choices and contributions.
- **True Digital Ownership:** All items and lore exist as NFTs and metadata on-chain and IPFS.
- **Artist-Owned Economy:** $OSIEN tokenomics reward artists and participants.

This repository contains everything you need to launch, extend, or integrate The Ossuary, or to acquire and continue its development as a complete intellectual property package.
