## Project Overview

The Ossuary blends art, mythology, and blockchain into a living, decentralized legend. Users perform rituals using $OSIEN tokens, powered by Chainlink VRF, to summon unique Relics, unlock hidden Lore Fragments, and support real artists. The project features mutable NFTs, community-driven lore, and a true artist-owned economy.
