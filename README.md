# The Ossuary

The Ossuary is a blockchain-based occult-themed NFT ecosystem built on the Ethereum network. It leverages the ERC-1155 token standard to create a multi-token collection with dynamic ritual evolution mechanics powered by Chainlink VRF for provable randomness. The project includes the $OSIEN token, which facilitates rituals, upgrades, and in-game utilities.

## Features

- **ERC-1155 NFT Collection:** Flexible multi-token standard supporting various item types and tiers.
- **Ritual Evolution Mechanics:** NFTs evolve through on-chain rituals that use verifiable randomness.
- **Chainlink VRF Integration:** Ensures fair and tamper-proof randomness for rituals.
- **$OSIEN Token:** Utility token powering rituals, upgrades, and other project features.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed for future expansion including marketplaces and spin-offs.
