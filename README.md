**IMPORTANT:**  
- Make sure your actual file path is exactly `code/License.md` (case-sensitive!).
- If you visit: `https://github.com/The-Ossuary/bookish-waffle/blob/main/code/License.md`  
  and see your license file, then the link above will work.
- If the file is at the root (not in `code/`), the link should be `[License](License.md)`.  
- If the file is named differently (like `Licence.md` with a "c"), update the link to match.

Let me know if you want a full README example with this included, or if you need help moving/renaming the file!
