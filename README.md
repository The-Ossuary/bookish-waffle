# The Ossuary

**The Ossuary** is an experimental Web3 game built on Ethereum. Enter a collaborative, occult-inspired ritual platform where every on-chain action is a “ritual” that creates, mutates, or destroys NFTs. Shape the living lore of a crypt-city—with art, sacrifice, and creativity—using smart contracts and $OSIEN tokens.

## Project Overview

The Ossuary is a fully on-chain Web3 game fusing art, mythology, and blockchain. Players perform smart contract-powered rituals using $OSIEN tokens and Chainlink VRF randomness to summon unique Relic NFTs, unlock hidden lore, and support real artists.

- **Web3 Ritual Gameplay:** Every action is on-chain and changes the game world.
- **Mutable NFTs:** Items and lore fragments can be created, mutated, and destroyed.
- **Community-Driven Lore:** Player choices expand the crypt-city’s story.
- **True Ownership:** All assets exist as NFTs and metadata on-chain and IPFS.
- **Artist Economy:** The $OSIEN token rewards artists and active players.
