# The Ossuary

## Overview

The Ossuary is a Web3 gaming platform where players mint, evolve, and trade dynamic NFTs called "Relics" using AI-powered rituals. Unlike static NFTs, these assets transform over time through player choices, AI storytelling, and in-game events. This creates a living, evolving collectible system that deepens community engagement and marketplace activity.
