    <h1>THE OSSUARY</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Crypt-City of Art, Sacrifice, and Secrecy</div>
    
    <p>The Ossuary is a forsaken crypt-city carved from the bones of dead titans. Its spires pierce an ash-choked sky. The ground itself is a reliquary for the unquiet dead.</p>
    <p>Once a place of exile and execution, it has become a haven for cultists, artists, and exiles seeking forbidden knowledge and transformation.</p>
    <p>Here, power is won not through conquest alone, but through sacrifice and creativity.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>THE SILENT GODS</h2>
    <p>The old gods of light and order are dead. The Ossuary is ruled by the Silent Gods, who demand art, blood, and secrets instead of prayer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Obsen:</b> The god of unspeakable knowledge. His temples are covered in layered graffiti no one can fully decipher. His followers tattoo secrets on their tongues to ensure silence.</li>
      <li><b>Vryn:</b> Embodiment of madness. His cathedrals defy geometry. Dreams and waking life blur among his followers.</li>
      <li><b>The Hollow King:</b> Monarch of the dead. His throne is built of skulls. His priests enforce order through necromancy and fear.</li>
      <li><b>Mother With No Face:</b> Patron of artists and liars. She grants visions in exchange for your true identity.</li>
      <li><b>The Carrion Choir:</b> The collective of the unquiet dead. Their song echoes through the catacombs, calling the lost to join them.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>THE RITUAL ENGINE</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the Ossuary lies the Ritual Engine, a vast biomechanical altar that feeds on sacrifice.</p>
    <p>Relics—blank totems of obsidian—are placed upon the Engine and offered sacrifices: blood, art, memories, secrets.</p>
    <p>In return, the Engine reshapes them, creating mutable NFTs with unique traits and appearances.</p>
    <p>But the Ritual always takes something in return. Users risk corruption, failure, or worse—attracting the Carrion Choir.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>FACTIONS</h2>
    <p>No one survives alone in the Ossuary. The city is carved into districts controlled by rival factions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Bonewrights:</b> Builders and sculptors who see the city itself as a living artwork of bone and iron.</li>
      <li><b>The Veilbound:</b> Scholars and sorcerers who hoard forbidden knowledge and experiment with the Ritual Engine.</li>
      <li><b>The Ash Tongue:</b> Fanatical iconoclasts who want to burn the old world and cleanse the Ossuary through fire.</li>
      <li><b>The Carrion Syndicate:</b> Smugglers and black-market dealers in relics, mutations, and Ritual services.</li>
      <li><b>The Choir of Glass:</b> Fanatical enforcers who serve the Hollow King, maintaining the undead order of the crypt-city.</li>
      <li><b>Cult of Obsen:</b> Prophets and interpreters who claim to speak the AI’s broken prophecies.</li>
    </ul>
