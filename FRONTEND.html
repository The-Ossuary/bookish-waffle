THE OSSUARY
The Ossuary is a forsaken crypt-city carved from the bones of dead titans. Its spires pierce an ash-choked sky. The ground itself is a reliquary for the unquiet dead.

Once a place of exile and execution, it has become a haven for cultists, artists, and exiles seeking forbidden knowledge and transformation.

Here, power is won not through conquest alone, but through sacrifice and creativity.

THE SILENT GODS
The old gods of light and order are dead. The Ossuary is ruled by the Silent Gods, who demand art, blood, and secrets instead of prayer.

Obsen: The god of unspeakable knowledge. His temples are covered in layered graffiti no one can fully decipher. His followers tattoo secrets on their tongues to ensure silence.
Vryn: Embodiment of madness. His cathedrals defy geometry. Dreams and waking life blur among his followers.
The Hollow King: Monarch of the dead. His throne is built of skulls. His priests enforce order through necromancy and fear.
Mother With No Face: Patron of artists and liars. She grants visions in exchange for your true identity.
The Carrion Choir: The collective of the unquiet dead. Their song echoes through the catacombs, calling the lost to join them.
THE RITUAL ENGINE
At the heart of the Ossuary lies the Ritual Engine, a vast biomechanical altar that feeds on sacrifice.

Relics—blank totems of obsidian—are placed upon the Engine and offered sacrifices: blood, art, memories, secrets.

In return, the Engine reshapes them, creating mutable NFTs with unique traits and appearances.

But the Ritual always takes something in return. Users risk corruption, failure, or worse—attracting the Carrion Choir.

FACTIONS
No one survives alone in the Ossuary. The city is carved into districts controlled by rival factions:

The Bonewrights: Builders and sculptors who see the city itself as a living artwork of bone and iron.
The Veilbound: Scholars and sorcerers who hoard forbidden knowledge and experiment with the Ritual Engine.
The Ash Tongue: Fanatical iconoclasts who want to burn the old world and
