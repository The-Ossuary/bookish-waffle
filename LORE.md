# THE OSSUARY

The Ossuary is a forsaken crypt-city carved from the bones of dead titans. Its spires pierce an ash-choked sky. The ground itself is a reliquary for the unquiet dead.

Once a place of exile and execution, it has become a haven for cultists, artists, and exiles seeking forbidden knowledge and transformation.

Here, power is won not through conquest alone, but through sacrifice and creativity.

## THE SILENT GODS

The old gods of light and order are dead. The Ossuary is ruled by the Silent Gods, who demand art, blood, and secrets instead of prayer.

- **Obsen:** The god of unspeakable knowledge. His temples are covered in layered graffiti no one can fully decipher. His followers tattoo secrets on their tongues to ensure silence.
- **Vryn:** Embodiment of madness. His cathedrals defy geometry. Dreams and waking life blur among his followers.
- **The Hollow King:** Monarch of the dead. His throne is built of skulls. His priests enforce order through necromancy and fear.
- **Mother With No Face:** Patron of artists and liars. She grants visions in exchange for your true identity.
- **The Carrion Choir:** The collective of the unquiet dead. Their song echoes through the catacombs, calling the lost to join them.

## THE RITUAL ENGINE

At the heart of the Ossuary lies the Ritual Engine, a vast biomechanical altar that feeds on sacrifice.

Relics—blank totems of obsidian—are placed upon the Engine and offered sacrifices: blood, art, memories, secrets.

In return, the Engine reshapes them, creating mutable NFTs with unique traits and appearances.

But the Ritual always takes something in return. Users risk corruption, failure, or worse—attracting the Carrion Choir.

## FACTIONS

No one survives alone in the Ossuary. The city is carved into districts controlled by rival factions:

- **The Bonewrights:** Builders and sculptors who see the city itself as a living artwork of bone and iron.
- **The Veilbound:** Scholars and sorcerers who hoard forbidden knowledge and experiment with the Ritual Engine.
- **The Ash Tongue:** Fanatical iconoclasts who want to burn the old world.
